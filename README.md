# genAI-data-obfuscator
No one knows for sure what happens to the data you submit to GenAI. Let's anonymise and obfuscate any identifying data, just in case. This will deploy a very lightweight tool hosted in Azure Blob Storage. It will obfuscate any keywords you define, and provide you with a cleaned output you can then paste into your genAI chats.
